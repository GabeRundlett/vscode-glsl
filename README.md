# grsls README

## Features

This extension uses GLSLANG to give GLSL intellisense and linting, as well as goto-definition and much more.

## Requirements

Windows support is flaky, and MacOS support doesn't exist.

## Extension Settings

Eventually, I'd like it if the extension could take in compile commands

## Known Issues

Windows may be buggy, crashing on start but may start up and work perfectly.
MacOS support pending...

## Release Notes

None at this time.
